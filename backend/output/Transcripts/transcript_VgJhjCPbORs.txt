0.96: hi I'm Rahul and I'll be giving you a
3.32: quick demo of our Shuka model which
5.6: directly takes in audio as input and
8.28: tries to generate a response in English
11.04: um so let me ask the first question
14.759: now
19.68: bubble as you can see it U understood my
22.439: question and has started um answering
25.76: quite quickly if you noticed so this is
28.119: the main advantage of audio language
30.84: models they uh don't need an
33.44: intermediate speech recognition step
35.559: which makes the turnaround time much
38.44: faster
40.039: so the answer is quite detailed um it
46.0: goes through the iterations and so on
48.6: okay looks quite good uh let me Pro it a
51.28: bit
52.239: further is algorithm python Implement
58.719: please okay okay uh now it goes on to
61.76: write
62.68: code
65.6: and uh okay it's also giving us example
70.479: usage and some explanation of what the
73.439: code does and so on okay um we can also
76.88: see the conversation history here uh
80.64: which is helpful because we can better
83.04: understand what the context to the model
85.56: is and so
86.84: on uh which might come in handy right so
89.96: so let us now ask another question but
93.28: uh in a different language right to see
95.439: if it can handle multiple languages in a
97.56: single
99.96: conversation algorithm C++ rewrite
107.56: please okay it seems to have understood
109.88: and is proceeding to rewrite the
112.399: code
114.36: um yeah this can be quite powerful since
117.119: it removes much of the pre-processing we
119.28: need to do um for voice interfaces right
123.039: like language identification Etc before
126.52: uh we pass the inputs to the language
129.319: model okay so it looks
132.64: like it has uh Rewritten it correctly so
136.959: let's move on uh to ask a question in
141.04: English this
143.0: time can you make this code
147.92: recursive okay
150.72: so it goes on to do that so uh another
153.8: advantage of this model uh and our
156.04: approach in general is that we only
158.56: finetune a small portion of this whole
160.8: network right so we do not touch the
163.2: language model specific weights which
165.44: means that we can easily swap uh the
168.28: language model out to a a stronger model
171.76: in the future right so okay it seems to
175.44: have finished and finally let me ask um
179.36: about the the complexity of this
182.2: algorithm either complexity analysis
189.319: please okay it's giving some details
191.959: about the space complexity time
195.2: complexity and so on which is
198.319: good and yeah looks okay all right so
203.36: that was Shuka our uh new open- source
206.44: audio LM which can understand 10 index
209.2: languages and is available for you to
211.319: try out on hugging face thank you
