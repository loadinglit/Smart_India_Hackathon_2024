2.679: hi I am moit and I'll be giving you a
4.48: short demo of suram 2B a 2 billion
6.359: parameter model which we have trained
7.839: from scratch in this demo I'll be
9.76: comparing its performance with B Lama
11.4: 3.1 8 billion since this is a pre-end
13.96: model it cannot follow instructions but
15.879: just do completions let's get started
17.88: with a simple Hindi completion so I'll
20.48: paste my prompt which
23.8: says which means three Freedom Fighters
26.32: before India's independence are
30.199: okay what I'll do is I'll paste this in
32.119: Google Translate so that everyone can
34.559: understand so suram Tob says Mahatma
37.239: Gandhi B ganga and La after India's
40.559: independence in 1947 many Indians worked
42.6: hard to unite their country this eff was
44.48: led by J N who was the first Prime
46.039: Minister of India that time okay so it
48.52: has given three Freedom Fighter names
49.84: and has went into some details that took
51.44: place after Independence it looks like
53.0: that okay let's face the same PRP in
55.48: Lama
62.719: so Lama says ramachandra GHA New Delhi
65.36: senior leader of BH J party and former
67.36: Union Minister ramachandra GHA said that
70.119: three there were three Freedom Fighters
72.04: in India before independence he said
75.24: this okay it has not given the three
78.32: Freedom Fighter names but has went into
80.2: some news article things
82.56: okay H one more thing I want to show is
86.079: Lama has printed almost like 10 12 lines
88.759: and it has used 5 12 tokens while servum
92.079: Tob has printed around similar amount of
94.32: TXS but it has used only 278 tokens that
97.119: is like almost half the tokens but same
98.88: amount of words this is because serum 2B
101.119: has much more efficient tokenizer in
102.72: Indian languages than Lama moving on
105.52: let's try an example in Tamil so I what
109.399: I'll do is I'll translate my prompt in
111.92: Tamil and the prompt says significant
115.159: differences between the architecture of
116.68: cholas and pandas one so basically
119.24: prompting the to give me
123.479: markdown I will have to paste this in
125.6: Google
126.6: Translate There You Go says
129.36: architectural style the cholas
131.08: architecture mostly focused on religious
132.76: structur such as temples and palaces
134.519: which were Grand and onet a
136.44: characteristic of Chola architecture is
138.04: that it is decorated with increate
139.959: carvings and elaborate carvings P's pan
143.36: architecture was generally seen more in
145.0: cities and settlements than in temples
146.48: or palaces the design probably correct
149.599: and the text is quite coherent the
151.44: English sounds much much good okay let's
154.44: give the same from to
157.68: Lama okay it has moved away from Tamil
160.76: script and started English it says Chas
164.159: and were two most power both had
166.04: significant okay the cholas tool over a
168.76: vast Empire that stretched from Tamil
170.44: Nadu to parts of Andra
173.239: Pradesh okay here is our answer which we
175.519: were looking for maybe one notable
177.4: difference between two dynasties was
178.64: their architectural styles
180.48: Stone pillars cut columns yeah not a
183.04: very good job I'll prefer the output of
185.879: servant to be over the Lama moving on to
188.879: next test of the model what I'll do now
191.0: is I'll give a paragraph and ask the
193.2: model to summarize so this paragraph
195.239: talks about an activity where a general
197.48: where a British general asked its Army
199.4: to openly fire on the people who were
201.68: protesting against a rolet
204.48: act and I'll give this in
207.319: Punjabi and ask the model to summ in
210.08: three
211.56: points
213.2: Punjabi okay here is our paragraph and
215.439: then I'm asking to summarize in three
217.28: points let's see what Sur Tob can do
220.64: okay it has given three
223.04: points on April 1399 the am Mas get to
226.08: place this happened after large laak it
228.64: included the gka and sik infantry
231.64: regiments of the British okay not a very
234.0: good job but pretty
235.599: decent let's try with Lama 3.1
244.0: okay yeah it has hallucinated to give
246.4: some article L articles which detail
248.72: about
250.519: master yeah quite bad compared to Sur to
253.48: be okay now what I'll do is I'll give a
256.359: code and we'll ask the model to explain
258.359: in Tel so this code is basically talking
261.639: about factorial program in recursive and
265.36: what I want the model to do is explain
267.32: me in Tamil uh sorry
273.28: so explain in Telo my expectation is
275.52: some explanation should come in Telo
277.759: okay something has
281.36: come in this program we first Define a
283.639: function called factorial which takes an
285.0: integer NS parameter this function uses
287.199: recursion to calculate the factorial the
288.88: base case is base case is when n is z or
291.36: one in which case the function returns
294.16: one or one respectively otherwise it
295.68: calls itself recursive call and
297.16: multiplies the result by the current
298.32: number yeah sounds correct for a
300.24: vectorial function let's see what Lama
302.759: gives
304.4: out okay recursive function base case
308.24: recursive case yeah it neither sounds
311.44: coherent in telu probably and even the
313.919: English looks like
315.919: broken let's try another task in OA what
319.28: I'll do is I've given few shot for
321.96: translation here is an English sentence
324.28: and here is an AIA
327.0: sentence and this is its translation so
330.16: my expectation from this is uh the model
332.199: should output the translation of this
333.4: sentence the first AR that Harry Potter
335.88: destroyed was Tom Riddle's
337.639: Diary okay I'll translate this back to
340.72: English the first H that Harry Potter
343.28: broke was Tom rid diary perfect let's
345.919: see what Lama can
350.24: do uh it has hallucinated a bit but
353.319: let's see what this is probably wrong
355.0: okay Harry Potter something something so
357.72: this demo clearly shows the reasoning
359.199: and understand understanding skills of
360.36: this model in Indian culture history and
362.0: languages it it it has easily
364.68: outperformed the best open source model
366.599: out there yeah
