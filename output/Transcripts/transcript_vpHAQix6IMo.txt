4.24: hello skuts welcome to episode five of
7.24: sko learnings today we will be learning
10.36: about Barcode Scanner troubleshooting
12.92: with Mr azimuddin Khan from best
15.6: barcodes so let's begin hi aim G very
20.24: good morning yeah good morning mam good
22.56: morning good morning everyone how are
23.96: you I am fine mam a f great great so uh
28.599: uh all this konut we have our speaker
30.96: for the day here with us uh he's Mr
33.719: aimin Khan uh the tech lead at best
37.32: barcodes and he is our guest people for
40.0: the day he'll be taking you with the
43.079: entire process of troubleshooting our
45.399: printers or
49.52: scann so over to you now sir we are all
52.76: very excited for this training uh I
55.6: really hope to uh have a great learning
58.64: out of this thank you so
61.199: okay thank you thank you madam hi
63.519: everyone so this is aim and today I will
67.56: introduce you about our decode product
70.759: actually we are a manufacturer of decode
74.88: decode brand printer and scanners
88.92: so
92.079: related all the technical related query
95.36: and product specifications everything we
98.32: will we will cover today so I think we
102.64: should start with a uh so uh one second
107.68: let me share my screen this is the our
110.68: uh product record product we have
113.399: categorized this in four category
117.479: uh so it first one
122.28: scan
124.2: scan how many models are there in
126.84: Scanners and how many models are there
130.039: label printer and receip printer and
132.76: same mobile printer so Char
137.319: category one by one I will
148.84: explain
152.959: so let's start from
155.48: scanner so we have we have total six
158.76: model scanner if you see here I have
162.28: categorized this wired Wireless and
165.2: BT
166.76: so model DC 51 this is the wi wi scanner
172.519: and then DC
174.08: 5112 this one W wide and
177.56: wireless a wire wir
182.12: TC 512 BT 512 BT this is the Wireless
186.44: Plus BT scan so basically there is three
190.04: Model 51 5112 and 5112 BT
203.12: so this is the 1 Barcode Scanner and
207.68: 5.21 same wire this is the 2D Barcode
211.319: Scanner 1D and 2D means there is barcode
215.0: type barcode symbology okay so this is
218.519: the our barcod scanner so I will show
222.159: you one by one if you can see this one
225.28: so you will get a manual inside this and
227.519: you will get a cable also in this and
230.36: this is the our scanner so scanner a
233.2: cable
238.72: or I help you there is many uh Pro
242.439: programmable barcode in the manual with
244.48: the help of manual you can program the
246.12: scanner according your requirement okay
249.319: so
251.439: scan other side will be connect in the
254.439: host like PC mobile computer where do
258.239: you want to take the
260.12: data okay so and this one
263.96: 5.21 means there is wi scanner do model
267.04: and wi there is two model in the wi
268.84: scanner one is 1D and two the second is
271.4: 2D so this one 2D wi
276.44: scanner manual and you will get a cable
280.919: also or
293.52: scanner there is different between scan
297.84: engine I will explain later
300.36: about
303.479: SC so we have connected this the cable
307.479: now scanner is ready to work we just
310.68: need to connect the cable in the
317.84: laptop will be a light on the
328.639: scanner
330.319: like
335.12: this like this you can see in the
350.08: video scan
353.0: second 2D scanner 2D scanner can read 1D
356.44: and 2D both barcod but 1D scanner only
360.12: can scan One D Bar
362.039: Code
364.12: okay so this is the basic uh very simple
367.68: to connect any Scanner with the
369.88: system and if this is the Plug and Play
372.4: device so now we will move on the wless
376.08: scanner so here is two scanners one 5112
380.28: and second one 5122 a 1 wiress and
383.44: second is 2D Val up uh structure wise it
388.12: will be same but there is a different
391.12: between scan engine only there is a scan
393.319: engine I will show you scan engine later
396.56: okay so we will unbox one by one and
400.039: we'll show
401.599: you so this is the same manual there is
404.639: many program bar code inside
407.639: manual and here is you also get a cable
411.08: because
416.84: c c you can use also
423.24: cable and here is the
425.96: D so basically how to connect the dongle
429.16: with the scanner
432.24: I you can connect the dong through
435.24: Scanner with the help of manual I will
437.12: show
438.28: you in video you can see this
441.84: is normal
446.36: USB no no
448.199: no it only can work with
451.199: scanner okay
455.56: yeah basically this one 2.4g uh wiress
459.12: USB
466.479: adopter okay same like you will get a
476.4: manual you will get also a cable in
479.759: every scanner you will get a cable and a
482.039: scanner and in Wireless and BT models
484.36: you will get a extra USB adopter that's
491.84: it okay now how to connect how to
496.479: connect
505.8: SC SC to connect Scanner with the
510.759: okay you have to scan 2.4g
514.88: barcode
521.44: then connect the doal in the
526.279: system andan
536.68: 2.4
538.44: yes
540.519: now now see you can
546.0: see
549.04: data
553.6: Sy this
559.12: one you can also connect this
562.68: one
568.36: through
570.04: it will be really
572.92: great
575.32: orar okay okay okay sure M
580.04: okay just after it I will show you sure
583.8: thank
598.32: you
601.16: so this is the
614.68: same
616.36: communication Wireless and BT there is
619.44: only a difference
625.6: communication so all the same uh cable
629.48: manual and Barcode Scanner same like
631.72: other scanner you can get it inside the
657.8: Box device B connect same like that you
661.32: can connect this one
666.44: also apart from this handhold handheld
671.24: scanner tblop
673.76: scanners yeah table
684.0: toop that's
686.16: it same like wi scanner
690.36: there is also video in the YouTube you
692.36: can share this uh YouTube link in the
694.88: group your group so that
718.24: there
735.959: if you is
738.16: there
748.16: okay
750.519: okay now now now I
753.56: will
760.839: difference is the basic vertic line set
764.04: of vertical line like you can see here
767.959: set up vertical
770.72: line and line this one the 1D
778.12: barcode
780.519: Square barod
783.12: Bally
794.36: sing Tye basically this one 2D
808.12: barod
838.04: 3993
851.0: this one and this one
853.92: barod okay okay
858.12: soan what is the inside scanner now we
861.24: come on technical part okay what is the
864.72: inside scanner okay there is the trigger
867.36: button okay and this one the outer
870.04: structure and inside there a scan engine
873.079: and Trigger board okay now if you open
877.079: this one if we will open what we will
880.0: get inside okay I will show you okay so
884.519: we will get scan engine like this inside
887.12: this one 1D scan engine 1D scan engine
890.199: and this one 2D scan engine basically 2D
893.48: scan engine is the image base scanner
896.0: and is the laser base scanner so
927.959: con
933.319: okay
957.92: suppose
967.199: if any part got faulty you can replace
969.92: okay now I will show you the what which
973.44: Maximum issues what kind of issues we
975.88: can face and what is the solution with
979.079: that issue I will show you if scanner is
982.0: not getting on why sometime what happens
986.24: customer purchase the scann and he that
989.48: scan is not getting
1013.6: on power maybe there is any shortage in
1016.44: the USB port and maybe USB
1019.6: FY that one last last one
1027.76: [Music]
1029.679: is is not connected properly or there
1033.079: issue USB port so we have to check that
1036.64: that
1047.84: point
1057.799: and second scan not getting
1071.919: on the battery status okay maybe the
1075.919: battery is dead so we have to charge
1077.919: that battery first
1080.08: and after
1088.84: thaty and third one scanner has laser
1091.52: but cannot treat the
1093.559: barcode
1098.08: mean scanner is okay scan is getting
1101.36: laser scan providing laser but cannot
1103.799: read any barcode not able to read the
1105.679: barcode so condition what we have to
1109.32: do so maybe barcode damage
1114.52: dbe there is any issue the that barcode
1118.36: that's why it is not scanning and second
1121.2: scanning distance is not
1123.4: correct
1125.0: barcode maybe the distance between barod
1128.24: and the scanner may be different maybe
1131.08: not compati in the uh different
1134.64: differences between barcod and the uh
1137.64: scanner so we have to maintain a proper
1141.4: uh distance also suppose this is the our
1144.44: scanner and this is the barcode okay
1147.6: customer is complaining that barcode is
1149.2: not scanning so when
1152.24: when from here it can scan okay
1156.76: but if we do like this from here so it
1160.6: will not discan okay so we have to check
1164.52: that what is basically happening there
1167.799: how is customer use using that
1175.0: one and fourth one
1177.679: scanner is reading barcode but cannot
1180.36: uploading
1182.159: data barcod scan it is scanning okay but
1187.52: in the system data is not
1195.72: uploading we can check maybe our if we
1198.96: are using Wireless scanner then maybe
1201.48: our wireless USB receiver has not
1205.0: aligned with the
1218.4: scanner maybe c not connected
1226.64: properly okay and the fifth one scanner
1231.36: is uploading wrong bar wrong decoding
1235.28: barode
1238.4: uhod suppose we have 1 2 3 4 five inside
1242.28: the barcode and while we scanning we are
1244.919: getting data different data like 1 2 3 4
1248.64: 5 uh here is 1 2 3 4 5 and we are
1251.88: getting 10 11 12 like that so in that
1256.28: condition maybe keyboard select
1259.48: wrong means country code there is
1265.28: many
1279.64: maybe okay please
1282.12: next laser appears and then goes out but
1285.24: there is no data display in the input
1287.559: box Wireless
1296.44: coming and disappearing like laser come
1298.72: and go like that like that is
1300.88: happening so what may be
1305.36: issue so there is many there is four
1308.24: reason can be basically maybe USB
1310.64: receiver has not plugged into the PCV
1313.0: port and second one maybe Port this is
1315.919: out of condition maybe Port had d
1319.36: maybe USB receiver is not mat with the
1321.279: scanner yes maybe there is different
1323.72: receiver we are using with this scanner
1325.88: maybe mismatch the barod USB receiver
1329.679: and last one maybe scanner set to
1331.4: storage mode or USB virtual comp so
1333.72: there is also a mode scanning mode that
1337.32: is uh real time scanning and storage
1340.52: mode in storage mode you can store the
1343.159: data inside the scanner and later we can
1346.36: uh we can upload in the PC
1349.36: so maybe that one is the different maybe
1352.52: storage mode if this one is storage mode
1354.64: then real time at the real time it
1356.76: cannot upload the data three four reason
1360.4: what is the solution solution if there
1363.6: is issue with USP receiver you can
1365.6: change the receiver you can get right
1369.559: receiver
1376.08: receiver receiver unplug
1393.44: while conne scner with PC so USB device
1396.44: not recognized yes suppose we have
1399.12: connected this Cable in the scanner in
1401.6: the
1405.44: PCB device not recognized means USB
1408.919: device is not compatible not recognized
1411.12: like that so you can check the USB port
1415.24: or maybe
1437.44: cable
1441.72: Maxim and last one
1445.52: Trier and last one 1D barcode is reading
1448.48: but 2D barcode is not reading okay this
1451.36: is about 2D scanner suppose if we have
1454.4: 2D scanner it is scanning ond barcode is
1457.32: scanning but 2D barcode is not able to
1460.0: scan 2D barcode okay so uh issue is that
1465.48: maybe 2D barcode is not enabled in this
1467.84: scan engine
1469.24: so we have to enable the 2D barcode so
1472.2: that it can read 2D barcode also in the
1475.24: manual you will
1477.2: get I'll show
1479.36: you how to
1482.72: enable Okay this is the
1487.84: manual here is the wireless how to
1490.399: connect wireless how to connect BT and
1493.64: then how to how to check battery status
1497.039: also you can get many programming
1499.399: barcode in this manual
1502.399: okay and
1504.2: later you can enable barcode from this
1508.32: also so here is the mini barcode if 2D
1512.0: barcode is not able to read you can
1514.399: enable from here enable 2D barcode yeah
1517.12: enable any particular barcode you can
1519.12: also disable any particular
1521.159: barcode so this manual is going to help
1524.88: you a lot uh many many program
1528.799: programming configuration barcodes is
1531.36: there
1533.52: okay so that's it about
1536.559: scanners uh okay thank you so much a aim
1540.399: G for uh such detailed uh description
1548.0: and
1554.52: solution
