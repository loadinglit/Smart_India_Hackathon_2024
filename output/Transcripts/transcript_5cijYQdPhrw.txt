0.69: [Music]
5.16: hello skaut my name is Dad welcome to
7.319: another inside
12.36: episode the flying drones existing
15.08: logistic
22.279: indry so let me introdu to our guest
25.48: speaker of the day
27.279: mran
28.96: Dr cross so let's begin hi good morning
33.079: namaskar
34.12: everyone uh good to have you all
36.84: here uh just wanted to take a few
39.16: minutes maybe to share some things that
41.6: uh would become very relevant for us
44.64: very
45.68: soon let's start
50.0: here let's start by first asking
52.84: ourselves what exactly is a drone
55.16: because a lot of people out there keep
57.44: talking about drones and all the
58.96: miraculous and Magic magical things that
60.68: they are doing with drones but uh
63.96: honestly there there really isn't much
66.439: Clarity in terms of uh what exactly is
69.759: the Drone so let's try and figure that
71.759: out first so let's take a look at this
74.68: for
76.72: example if you were to look at this some
80.0: of these maybe you will realize yes is
82.68: very clearly a drone for example yes but
86.4: what if someone was to tell you that no
89.2: this is actually also a
91.72: drone or so is this or is this a
96.04: drone so how do you define a
101.84: drawn while you're doing that you will
104.079: also be thrown with terms like Radio
106.56: control aircraft remotely piloted
108.84: aircraft all kinds of big terminology
112.32: out
113.159: there as a
115.24: result it's it's it's become kind of
117.799: confusing for all of us to try and
119.28: figure out what exactly is a drone so
121.52: let's try and see what a drone is and
124.399: for that we'll probably go back to what
126.759: the dgca tells
128.84: us what a drone is now what is
132.0: dgca dgca is actually the regulatory
135.599: Authority for all kinds of civil
138.0: aviation in
139.72: India now that civil aviation includes
143.599: drones and what dgca tells you is that
147.76: drone means unmanned aircraft system
152.36: what this specifically mean is that if
154.2: you have a
155.239: system which is basically
157.76: unmaned it's an aircraft and it's being
160.959: remotely
162.159: controlled now here's the key thing out
164.4: here it should be remotely controlled
167.92: wirelessly then it's a
170.04: drone nowhere do they tell you that your
172.8: drone needs to have punas on top or
174.8: propellers on top or in the front or
176.599: bottom nowhere do they tell you that
178.8: your drone needs to look like like this
180.239: or that or whatever the simple
182.519: definition of drone is if it flies in
185.4: the air if it's remotely controlled if
189.04: it's remotely controlled wirelessly and
190.84: there's nobody sitting out there on the
192.599: aircraft it's a drone simple as that so
196.72: the key terms that we talking about over
198.599: here is there has to be some unmanned
202.0: aerial vehicle plus a remote station or
205.4: a remote
206.599: control okay that unman aial thing is
211.08: also sometimes referred to as remotely
213.72: piloted vehicle or remotely piloted
218.08: aircraft and having having seen this if
222.04: you try and come back to this and try
223.56: and figure out what exactly is a
226.64: drone a radio control boat is obviously
229.319: not a drone because it's not
231.599: aerial a hexacopter that is basically
235.36: what you and me have typically known as
237.64: drones with six propellers on top
240.239: is a drone a Diwali balloon is obviously
243.92: not a drone
245.28: because it's not remotely
248.159: controlled here's the interesting one a
250.439: radio control toy helicopter the kind
252.519: you get on Amazon or flip card or
255.04: whatever else it is an aerial vehicle it
258.16: is unmanned and it is wirelessly remote
260.359: controlled so according to dgca yes that
263.919: is a
265.44: drone then you have these big military
267.68: aircraft the ones made by drd and very
271.08: often used by the US definitely a drone
275.039: a typical radio control toy aircraft the
277.36: Chinese ones that you get in the market
279.44: again on Amazon or wherever else if you
282.08: notice yes it's
284.0: aial it's unmanned and it's wirelessly
287.32: remote controlled it is therefore a
291.56: drone coming to air taxis interestingly
294.8: no they are not drones simple reason
297.24: they are not unmined you have somebody
298.88: sitting out there on the machine
300.88: therefore they are not classified as
303.88: drones then you have these agre machines
306.32: the ones that we use for agricultural
308.0: spraying definitely a drone then you
310.919: have these small toy gliders toy planes
313.28: that children throw around yes they are
315.88: aial they are unmanned but they are not
318.16: remotely controlled so they are not
320.44: drones Diwali rocket yes of course it's
323.8: aial it's unmaned but not controlled so
327.199: not a drone RC toy car
330.0: kind of
331.24: obvious so that's what we mean when we
334.28: say a
336.56: drone interestingly again if you go back
339.12: and look at it nowhere did we talk about
341.36: a drone having propellers on top or
343.28: front or bottom or whatever else or the
345.68: shape and size or weight of a
349.08: draw coming to now what what all things
353.36: do we use drones for because typically
355.8: again when we talk about drones we have
357.6: this mental picture of you know was a
359.88: huge machine with multiple arms
361.759: propellers on top maybe doing pizar
365.44: delivery or
366.72: whatever interestingly there's a lot lot
369.599: more that drones are currently
371.88: doing and will do in the future let's
375.16: take a quick look at some of these
376.4: examples out here that we have a quick
380.0: video aial photography is obviously the
382.52: first one that we're going to talk about
384.759: take a
388.4: look
390.53: [Music]
426.8: all the different shape that you're
428.12: looking
430.28: [Music]
448.319: at
452.84: [Music]
472.199: dring on drone
473.58: [Music]
478.319: delivery
482.53: [Music]
507.43: [Applause]
509.91: [Music]
517.7: [Music]
557.079: the last one obviously is the one that
558.959: we most frequently talk about hear about
562.32: the military using machines to bomb
565.92: places any yeah having seen what what
569.36: all stuff that drones can be used for uh
574.519: maybe I think it's important to kind of
576.68: realize that right now if you're looking
579.959: at what 30 40 different
581.88: applications there's a new one being
583.76: created every single day limited only by
588.32: the imagination of what you can do with
590.36: this
592.079: machine but before you go down that
594.279: route I mean where you start talking
595.92: about using drones for real life
597.519: applications and what you can do with it
599.68: I think it's very important to
600.92: understand the regulations that uh
603.32: govern the current usage of drones and
606.72: how these impact us how these enable us
611.24: to do things also at the same
615.519: time I not go into the detail
617.72: regulations but there are important
619.519: things out there that each one of us
621.079: needs to know irrespective of whether we
623.72: currently
624.959: use or have a drone or not because even
628.279: if you're planning to buy buy a toy
629.64: drone some of these things will impact
632.8: you very quickly so let's get into
636.0: it where do you first of all find the
639.32: regulations uh the government of India
642.16: has set up something called the digital
643.6: Sky portal which is run by the dgca you
647.32: might want to kind of preserve these
648.72: URLs out
651.24: there this is where the latest drone
653.399: rules are
654.8: available at the same time they keep
657.0: making changes addendums notifications
660.04: whatever else which sometimes go out on
662.56: that Ministry of civil aviation website
665.24: or the dgca website itself or sometimes
669.279: the government being the government they
671.639: might put it out as a pib release pib
673.639: release is nothing but a standard
675.519: government circular which goes out on
677.56: the central government website out
680.04: there so important to note down
683.76: these again remember the government will
686.279: not come and tell you that these are the
687.72: rules these are not the rules or they
689.6: will not send you a text message saying
691.68: hey we change the rule out here you need
694.44: to go to these websites follow the
697.04: Publications and try and figure out what
699.279: is the latest thing that's happening out
701.0: there and make sure that you follow
706.48: it the first thing when we talk
709.519: about the the regulations is what all do
713.16: these regulations apply to they apply to
715.079: all kinds of drones all kinds of people
718.279: who own
719.48: operate Lee repair do whatever with
723.12: drones so it's not like you can
725.639: say drone
727.92: photography rules don't apply to me no
730.44: so it doesn't work that way if you have
733.12: a drone if you're operating it whether
734.8: you borrowed it what whatever the rules
737.36: apply to
739.12: you and it doesn't matter whether your
741.839: machine is what 50 g or 200 g or
744.519: whatever anything from0 gr to 500 kg you
749.04: are covered under the Drone rules simple
750.72: as
752.72: that you will be Exempted from the Drone
756.6: rules obviously if you work for the
759.92: military which most of us don't so we'll
763.0: skip that
765.44: part uh maybe we'll come back to this
768.72: later on let's talk about the
770.8: interesting thing that that a lot of the
772.88: media guys keep pushing on us and try
774.68: and figure out what exactly do they mean
777.399: by the classification of Dr drones and
780.56: you will keep hearing these terms like
782.24: Nano micro small
785.6: whatever basically when the dgca came up
788.199: with these drone rules they split the
791.76: the drones into various weight
795.56: categories honestly if you look at these
798.839: terms Nano micro small medium large
803.199: okay these are more
805.88: for the kind of payload and the total
808.88: weight that the machine
812.48: carries most of us would be stuck maybe
815.48: from between Nano to small kind of
818.279: category because beyond that becomes
821.199: really Advanced heavy important thing to
824.8: note out here is when when dgca talks
827.12: about the weight here they're talking
829.399: about the total total total weight of
832.199: your drone so you can't have a drone
834.88: which says let's say weighs 2 kgs and
838.0: can carry 500 G on top of that and you
840.0: say boss my drone weighs 2 kgs
842.44: no dgca will include the weight of the
846.12: payload when they try to classify
849.8: this interestingly in the Drone rules
852.88: 2021 which is the last latest version we
855.279: are working
856.839: with we created a new subcategory called
860.44: mrpa Model remotely piloted
863.72: aircraft which could be all the way from
865.88: 1 gr
867.68: to 25
871.32: G this subclassification or subcategory
874.6: specifically meant for
876.199: drones which are not meant for
878.839: commercial
880.04: use so let's say today out you go out
882.759: there and buy yourself a drone which
884.8: you're using for your own personal
886.36: photography
887.959: needs or maybe uh you want to drop drop
891.12: flower petals on your de one or whatever
894.8: as long as you're not using it
896.72: commercially it would get classified as
899.48: mrpa the interesting thing about mrpa is
902.68: that the kind of restrictions or
905.36: regulations that apply to it are
907.48: slightly less constructive compared to
911.079: commercial
913.279: draws the most important restriction
915.759: though however is that no
918.079: mrpa can be flown Beyond visual line of
921.32: sight that means whenever you're flying
923.199: it you should be able to see it with
925.199: your Naked
926.48: Eyes okay
930.959: now to try and understand better and how
933.839: these rules apply to
935.639: us simple way of remembering the whole
938.04: thing is ask
940.12: yourself what are you
942.839: flying why are you
945.12: flying and where are you flying because
947.959: all these three things are relevant for
950.04: you let's start with the B
953.839: BD the rules are very
956.88: clear every drone that you have you
960.639: operate you own you do whatever with has
963.68: to be
965.72: registered
968.72: okay in reality
971.24: though when you try to register a drone
973.8: let's say which weighs 100 gram or
975.279: anything less than 250 g they currently
978.48: do not have that option enabled although
981.639: on the rules on paper it very clearly
983.68: says yes it needs to be
987.16: registered what that basically means is
989.36: that if you go to Amazon or whatever and
991.199: buy your kid or yourself one of these
993.36: toy
996.759: drones you will need to register
1000.399: it coming back
1002.839: to the the regulations we spoke
1006.639: about what are we
1008.759: flying obviously if you're flying
1013.199: mrpa which is basically education
1016.319: research
1017.48: design personal use
1021.04: okay you don't need to have a pilot
1023.839: license you don't need a type
1028.079: certificate the next question to ask
1030.799: therefore is why am I
1032.919: flying and this is where I just
1036.28: mentioned if you are flying
1038.919: commercially now what do they mean by
1040.919: commercial so let's say you have a
1043.679: drone you take it to your friend's
1045.799: wedding start doing photography out
1047.799: there and charge them for it it becomes
1051.08: commercial
1052.799: okay the moment you start flying
1055.2: commercial the rules are very clear you
1058.64: need to have a pilot
1061.08: license simple as
1064.44: that for which you will need to undergo
1068.039: a formal training
1069.76: course appear for the
1072.88: exam and then bgca will issue you
1077.4: a
1082.6: so just to summarize the whole thing out
1090.44: here if you look at this
1093.84: again up to 25 kgs if you're not flying
1097.32: commercially
1099.6: mrpa okay okay uh so again coming back
1103.44: to like uh the classification that we
1105.799: were talking
1107.32: about
1109.08: the rules are very simple if you're
1111.4: flying
1112.52: commercially you need to have a pilot
1115.96: license simple as
1117.64: that and for that the process like I was
1120.159: saying
1121.24: earlier is you will need to undergo a
1123.559: formal training
1125.559: course you will need to give a written
1127.72: exam flying exam and then the dgca
1130.84: issues you what what they call a pilot's
1136.0: license if you're not flying commercial
1138.52: if you're flying only for your personal
1140.76: needs no license required provided
1145.4: provided your drone is less than 25
1149.679: kgs okay and if it's less than 2 kgs you
1153.96: don't even need a type certificate type
1155.76: certificate is nothing but uh a
1158.039: certification from the government saying
1159.76: that your machine is legal to fly in the
1162.2: Indian a
1164.799: space having seen
1167.24: this here's the part which is extremely
1170.559: extremely important for all of us
1173.0: irrespective of whether you're flying
1174.919: commercially non-commercially whether
1177.4: you're flying n Nano micro
1181.44: small the government has basically split
1184.32: the whole country into three
1188.72: zones and the rules for these zones are
1191.0: very
1191.799: simple if it's a Red Zone you're not
1195.559: allowed to fly period it doesn't matter
1199.64: whether you have a small toy drone small
1202.96: RC helicopter or whatever if you're in
1205.919: the Red Zone government says you are not
1209.679: allowed to
1211.64: fly then there are these massive yellow
1215.799: zones where yes you allowed to fly but
1219.52: you will need permission prior
1221.72: permission from the local air traffic
1225.24: controller so let's say you're flying
1227.4: somewhere around
1228.96: nask uh most of nask zone for example is
1231.96: a yellow zone you will need to go and
1235.2: approach the air traffic controller out
1237.64: there take permission and then you can
1240.039: fly realistically it doesn't
1243.159: happen so if you really break it down
1246.52: red and yellow zones are basically noo
1248.36: zones for
1249.32: you which leaves a huge part of the
1251.84: country which is actually a green zone
1255.08: where you allowed to fly without any
1257.12: kind of Prior permission
1258.679: you're allowed to fly commercially
1260.64: you're allowed to fly Nano micro small
1263.799: whatever else you
1265.52: have and where do you go and find these
1268.64: zones on the digital Sky portal if you
1271.36: go there and look at it very
1274.039: carefully there's a zoomable map given
1276.52: out
1277.88: there you can zoom into any part of the
1280.4: country that you want your current
1282.08: location for
1284.08: example and you'll know whether it's a
1286.12: red yellow or green
1290.039: interestingly if you look at the
1292.72: map most urban
1295.679: areas are red zones so whether you look
1298.24: at Delhi Bombay Kolkata Bangalore all
1303.08: red
1305.36: zones and this is extremely important
1308.919: because flying in a Red Zone if you are
1312.84: caught they'll put all kinds
1315.72: of whatever Indian police
1318.559: regulations they have on you and put you
1320.2: behind
1321.12: bars
1324.72: okay so again just to kind of summarize
1327.96: a red zone is no go unless you have
1331.76: prior permission from the central
1332.919: government which you and me are not
1335.76: getting yellow if you have permission
1338.2: from the local air traffic controller
1340.4: which again you and me normally don't
1343.159: get so normal human beings whether they
1346.64: are flying commercially or not
1348.6: commercially need to be playing in the
1352.159: green
1354.2: zone again within the green zone they
1356.6: put certain height restrictions which
1358.24: actually don't matter because 400 ft is
1361.279: normally high enough for us to you and
1363.559: me
1365.24: fly it's enough for us to do things the
1368.64: only restriction that applies in a green
1370.72: zone though is your drone should again
1373.6: be within visual line of sight which
1377.279: means you should be able to see it with
1378.6: the naked
1380.96: eye that regulation is currently being
1384.96: enhanced so maybe that might be taken
1387.039: off very soon in the near future because
1390.0: uh it's very relevant when you're
1391.44: talking about drone deliveries or
1392.799: whatever
1393.679: else that your drone might actually need
1396.2: to fly beyond your line of s but the
1399.32: rules keep getting enhanced modified as
1403.44: time goes by so hopefully that will come
1405.679: into place very soon
1410.72: talking about drone delivery
1412.64: specifically here's what the government
1414.679: actually put out way back in July
1419.24: 2022 they made it very clear that they
1421.679: don't have a problem with drone
1424.0: deliveries so they actually put out a
1426.36: pib circular a notification out there
1429.12: which says private players can use
1430.919: drones for drone delivery in accordance
1433.799: with the Drone rules of 2021 which is
1436.039: what we just spoke about
1439.4: so going forward yes the government is
1442.039: trying to encourage new areas of drone
1444.88: applications they are very much in favor
1446.88: of doing interesting things with
1448.96: drones is just that the rules and the
1452.96: technology will need a little bit of
1455.48: more time to kind of align themselves
1458.88: and for things to start happening on the
1464.32: ground let's talk a little bit more
1466.6: about Brad delivery specifically because
1469.48: this is actually a huge interest
1474.12: area why do we need drone delivery I
1476.399: mean why why on Earth could anybody even
1478.919: border about drone delivery very simple
1481.44: one it's faster it's more efficient more
1484.039: cost cost savings are
1485.96: there of course your customer has an
1488.96: enhanced
1490.88: experience I I mean actually I've just
1492.84: listed down a few points here but you
1495.2: can actually list down a whole number of
1496.96: things on why delivery through drones
1499.919: makes a lot of
1502.399: sense of course there are doubt
1505.2: sides some people will lose jobs I mean
1507.6: so typically if you have a guy sitting
1508.919: on a bicycle going from one place to
1511.2: another a drone will obviously be better
1513.48: than
1514.559: him there are obviously privacy and
1516.88: security concerns I mean people have
1519.159: problems with drones flying all over the
1520.72: planet all over the buildings but these
1523.64: are things I think that that come with
1525.399: any new
1526.36: technology and not too much of a concern
1528.72: area for us right
1533.08: now getting into more detail about drone
1536.679: delivery let's say we we want to start
1539.12: drone delivery doesn't matter what it is
1541.039: whether it's pizzas or maybe you want to
1543.559: deliver uh Parcels or whatever
1546.799: else again start with basic simple
1549.6: questions what do you want to deliver
1552.52: when you want to deliver because this
1554.52: will decide the process that you follow
1557.0: the kind of drones that you use the kind
1559.2: of Regulation that will apply to you
1561.279: everything else let's look at for
1563.799: example what do you want to
1566.679: deliver technically it could be
1569.32: anything
1571.039: medicines emergency supplies spare parts
1574.559: I mean for example Volkswagen right now
1576.399: is already uh delivering parts from one
1580.159: manufacturing plant to another using
1584.039: drones of course you might have heard
1586.2: about Amazon talking big about
1588.52: delivery through
1589.96: drones Walmart is doing it right now in
1592.44: the US so you and all of course they
1595.919: have big
1597.279: plans but again in the US food delivery
1600.159: is already happening through drones
1602.64: technically there's no no no limit to
1604.6: what you can
1605.919: deliver the reason it's important to you
1608.679: is you need to look at the weight of
1611.48: what you want to deliver the volume the
1614.32: total box size
1616.6: or
1618.96: dimensions of what you want to carry
1620.559: because that will determine the size of
1622.48: your
1624.2: drone the last thing that you might want
1626.24: to look at is survivability basically
1628.2: like there are things that you can for
1630.44: example pick up through a drone and drop
1632.0: from the
1633.08: air there are things that you will need
1635.159: to pick up on a drone and actually land
1637.36: to be able to drop
1639.399: it that becomes very relevant when
1641.679: you're talking about drone
1644.039: deliveries and we'll talk about this uh
1647.159: in a more detail very
1649.96: soon where do you want to
1653.559: deliver right now in India like I
1657.2: said the most important thing to look at
1659.559: is Are you delivering within line of
1662.0: sight or Beyond line of
1664.919: sight right now the rules do not allow
1668.159: Beyond line of sight they are working
1670.32: towards it it will
1673.48: happen
1675.039: but it's something very relevant for us
1678.6: right
1679.84: now second
1681.84: thing whether you're flying in urban
1684.12: area rural area
1686.08: whatever again the rules will change
1688.76: your flight environment will
1691.48: change you need to look at the kind of
1693.6: weather that you'll be flying in I mean
1696.0: you can't fly let's say from a place
1697.76: like
1698.96: Bombay and if you're going offshore the
1701.399: weather might be totally different out
1703.0: there and then the security area it's a
1706.64: high security highrisk area you might
1709.039: not be able to land your drone so that
1710.84: becomes very relevant and what kind of
1712.72: drones do we use for
1715.799: delivery there are three basic
1718.72: types the first being fixed Wing where
1721.519: you have a simple aircraft looking like
1724.919: thing which flies in the air typically
1728.0: these do not
1730.159: land they just drop your payload from
1732.64: the air and fly
1734.679: back the payload comes down using a par
1737.36: parachute or similar
1741.559: mechanism very commonly used in the US
1744.32: right
1745.08: now very commonly used in Africa by a
1747.88: company called zipline right
1753.36: now then you have these hybrid
1756.36: machines which have wings and propellers
1759.32: or rotors whatever you want to call
1762.2: them these things can take off
1764.48: vertically they can land vertically
1768.72: but they are extremely efficient because
1770.399: for horizontal flight
1773.24: cruising they have wings so they can
1776.08: cover a huge amount of
1778.32: distance and basically try and take
1780.559: advantage of you know carrying good
1783.64: payloads long
1786.519: distances the third type which is the
1788.88: most common one that the media keeps
1790.48: talking
1791.72: about is the so-called standard drone
1794.48: that
1795.279: un uh kind of always visualize typical
1799.6: machine with rotors on
1801.919: top can take off vertically land
1806.039: vertically unfortunately these machines
1808.399: because of the design cannot go very far
1811.88: so the range is
1814.32: limited and in terms of safety these are
1817.919: comparatively low safety machines
1819.799: because those propellers that are
1821.799: spinning up there can be extremely
1823.519: dangerous especially when you're trying
1825.44: to drop the payload or land to drop the
1831.32: payload in terms of the
1834.679: usage hybrid machines are right now the
1837.64: most commonly used
1839.919: machines for
1845.88: delivery talking about the typical
1850.039: process very simple approach one simple
1852.679: approach could
1853.84: be you basically pick up a load fly
1858.44: land and then you drop the load or
1860.6: somebody takes out the load from your
1862.679: drone and then you go back to your point
1865.519: of
1866.919: origin you would typically use this kind
1869.32: of process of mechanism where you have
1871.76: sensitive loads let's say for example
1873.559: you're trying to deliver human organs or
1876.88: something uh fragile
1879.88: Parts this is the kind of process that
1882.039: you would typically follow you would
1885.44: need people at both ends obviously
1887.88: to load unload whatever
1890.399: else and given the fact that you're
1892.6: landing and then taking off again going
1894.96: back you might need to refuel at the
1898.36: drop
1899.799: point the other commonly used mechanism
1902.48: is you don't
1904.48: land you pick up the payload you fly in
1907.039: the air and do an air drop through a
1909.12: parachute or a tethered line or whatever
1912.519: else and then just you fly back again
1915.84: this is used very commonly for for
1917.279: medical emergency
1918.639: deliveries very commonly used by zipline
1921.12: in Africa for example right now to drop
1924.76: vaccines medicines everything
1928.159: else you get much longer range with this
1930.799: kind of process but obviously we can't
1933.12: handle sensitive
1936.6: loads so that's how it works very
1942.159: simple here are the big guys out there
1944.44: in terms of drone delivery interestingly
1946.799: you notice any swiy or Amazon out
1949.679: here zipline is the one that I I keep
1952.519: talking about which the whole world
1954.48: knows the reason I'm I'm putting these
1956.799: up here is so that you get an idea of
1958.36: the kind of load that they carry and the
1960.08: kind of distance that they already
1962.48: covering for drone deliveries look at
1965.159: zipline for example they already doing
1968.48: deliveries over a range of 24 miles
1971.32: that's
1972.159: huge again UPS in the US is doing
1977.12: delivery for third Parties By the way
1979.6: they are right now delivering human
1982.159: organs from One hospital to
1985.399: another the range that they're talking
1987.44: about is typically 20 miles Mana again
1990.36: which is based out of Ireland they have
1992.36: their own custom design machines 10
1995.039: miles so tech technology wise we are
1997.96: very much there people are already doing
2000.799: it coming to India maybe maybe the
2003.36: regulations need to catch up a bit and
2005.559: maybe a little bit of more effort is
2008.32: required from our side to make things
2011.2: happen out
2013.76: here so what are the challenges we face
2016.279: in India
2017.32: specifically regulations honestly are
2020.639: one big
2022.36: bottleneck right now like I said the
2024.559: government does not allow bvs Beyond
2027.679: visual line of sight which is actually a
2029.84: big
2030.88: hindrance
2032.919: two we don't have enough skilled
2035.96: Manpower in a country of let's say what
2039.08: 1.4 billion we are right
2041.88: now if the government says boss for
2044.24: drone deliveries you need
2046.44: certified drone Pilots we have just less
2050.159: than 10,000 of them out
2052.2: there you don't have enough manpower to
2054.76: kind of really have drone deliveries
2057.32: take off in a big
2060.28: way very sadly again there are no Indian
2064.399: design or Indian made drones which are
2067.2: reliable enough for drone deliveries
2070.159: people are working in that direction
2072.32: things will
2076.079: change other big concern and this is one
2078.679: of the biggest things that I think you
2080.079: and we need to kind of start thinking
2081.96: about is Safety and Security I mean one
2085.48: classic example that I keep giving to
2087.119: people is boss today we live in a
2089.0: country where you can't leave your
2090.919: bloody slippers outside the Mand yeah
2093.48: you can't leave your bicycle
2095.24: unlocked so if you really want drone
2097.28: deliveries to take off I mean are you
2098.76: expecting me to send up a machine which
2100.28: is costing what six lakhs seven lakhs
2102.96: and then having somebody sitting on the
2104.28: Terrace bullet down it's something that
2106.68: we need to talk about and then think
2108.24: about if we want our country to
2112.44: progress on the other hand again given
2116.56: the cheap labor that is available in our
2120.96: country there's obviously cheap
2123.079: Alternatives available somebody might
2124.88: sitting on sitting on a motorbike might
2126.4: say
2130.599: and there goes your whole business case
2132.4: study use case study for a drone
2133.8: delivery goes out of the
2135.839: window but yes I mean I do see this
2138.56: happening because there are use cases
2142.48: where none of these would actually
2144.64: matter and the only option left with you
2146.4: might be use a
2149.56: draw uh in real life during the co
2155.119: pandemic the government is itself was
2157.4: actually delivering vaccines to remote
2159.079: areas using
2161.119: drones so yes has to be done needs to be
2164.839: done and will be done very
2169.319: soon what does the future look like for
2171.56: all of
2172.839: us costs are obviously going to reduce
2175.119: even further technology like I said is
2178.2: already
2180.52: there the use cases are limited only by
2183.8: our
2184.68: imagination the kind of students IDE
2186.76: deal with for example keep coming up
2188.24: with new ideas every day on what they
2189.8: want to do with
2191.2: drones and obviously needless to say
2194.0: customer expectations are increasing
2196.56: right now for example vanta wines wants
2198.76: to use drones
2200.24: for delivering stuff across their mines
2203.599: they also want to use the use the same
2205.56: drones for surveying the mines and
2208.76: figuring out what's happening so people
2211.68: are coming up with ideas expectations
2213.48: are increasing and the industry will
2215.88: have to deliver
2220.359: quick question answers I mean some
2223.319: common questions that are typically
2225.72: encounter how far can drone fly I've
2229.04: given you some
2231.079: examples technically the bigger the
2234.04: battery the more fuel you have the
2236.48: longer you can
2237.72: fly but there is obviously plate where
2241.599: you need to kind of balance out that if
2244.68: I have a big battery my weight increases
2246.68: therefore I can't fly too
2248.56: far but as you must have seen in the US
2252.2: they're already doing 20 mi 30 mil piece
2254.44: of
2255.8: cake how much weight can the machine
2258.2: carry basically depends on the
2261.44: design when we typically design these
2263.88: drones what we typically aim for is that
2265.92: 25% of the weight total takeoff weight
2269.44: should be reserved for the payload so if
2271.28: I have uh let's say a machine which has
2274.2: a takeoff weight of 1 kilo you you can
2276.8: say that it'll have a payload of around
2278.28: 250
2281.079: g interestingly people again ask this
2283.72: question very often that if I need to
2286.119: get into drone delivery drone operations
2288.119: or whatever else do I need I type
2291.2: Engineers bchs or whatever else simple
2294.119: answer is
2296.4: no there are people out there who are
2298.839: willing to
2299.92: learn quite a bit of talent available
2302.64: out there we need to train them bring
2304.359: them up to the mark and it can be done
2307.72: so that's about it I would like to end
2310.0: the session here thank you very much all
